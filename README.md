# Woopy

Code for the (textual) game app that students implement in [The Pragmatic Studio's Ruby Programming](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/ruby) course.

**Bonus**: I have also added code for [flicks](./flicks), the movie ranking app implemented in the [course](https://online.pragmaticstudio.com/courses/ruby-2ed/start) by the authors.
